## 2026-06-22 10:35 ET — Intraday Monitor

**Routine:** position_monitor

## 2026-06-22 15:48 ET — EOD Overnight Thesis Check

**Routine:** eod_position_review

Queried Perplexity AI for NVDA overnight thesis. Result: CLOSE recommended, confidence 68/100. No confirmed near-term catalyst for tomorrow (2026-06-23). Key risks cited: valuation elevated ($5T mkt cap, high expectations already priced in), no specific event catalyst tomorrow, macro/China policy uncertainty. Long-term bull case intact (Strong Buy consensus, $275 avg PT, Vera Rubin H2 launch) but insufficient for overnight hold per strategy exit criteria. Force-close trigger applied: "end-of-day with no overnight thesis."
---

## 2026-06-22 15:48 ET — NVDA EOD Close Executed

Submitted market sell order for 23 shares NVDA. Order ID: 9317f93a-81f0-4727-bdbf-2f04439647be. Fill price: ~$207.88. Exit value: $4,781.24. Entry cost: $4,907.87. Trade P&L: -$126.63 (-2.58% from entry $213.3857). Position held approximately 6 hours (09:39–15:48 ET). Reason: no overnight thesis per Perplexity AI (confidence 68).

## [2026-07-07 20:37 ET] — Market Open Trade Trigger Written

Market-open routine executed. Pre-checks: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 — clear to proceed. research_cache.md candidates >=70 (excluding SPY/QQQ benchmarks): NVDA (82), META (80), MSFT (78), PLTR (75), TSLA (73), AMZN (70 borderline). open_positions.md: none held. daily_context.md: SPY ~$750.19 above 5-day MA ~$742.96, VIX ~15.81 (well below 28) — TRADE_OK=yes, regular stock entries permitted, SH inverse not triggered. Wrote memory/trade_trigger.md (status: pending) with all six candidates for the Python executor to verify buying power/positions via Alpaca API and place a limit order on the top qualifying candidate, enforcing the 5% position size cap. Did not update open_positions.md, trade_log.md, or weekly_trade_counter.md — those are owned by the Python executor upon fill confirmation.
---

## [2026-07-07 20:38 ET] — Trade Trigger Processed, No Fill Recorded

Python executor flipped memory/trade_trigger.md status from pending to done, but open_positions.md, trade_log.md, and weekly_trade_counter.md (trades_this_week still 0/3) show no new position or fill. Executor likely rejected all six candidates during its own live checks (volume confirmation, buying power, or another guard) without leaving a reason in these memory files. No trade was placed this session. Recommend checking main.py's execution logs directly for the rejection reason on the next run.

Research complete. 13 tickers scanned. Top candidates: AMD(94), RIVN(82), AMZN(77). Market TRADE_OK=no, VIX=unconfirmed (Perplexity could not confirm VIX below 28; SPY near/below 5-day MA). Five tickers exceed entry threshold (>=70): AMD, RIVN, AMZN, NVDA(75), GOOGL(75). SMCI flagged bearish (36/100) on $7B dilution shock. No trades placed.

## 2026-06-29 09:30 ET
No trade placed on 2026-06-29. Market context check (Step 8) failed: (1) SPY is near/slightly below its 5-day MA — entry criterion requires SPY *above* 5-day MA; (2) VIX is unconfirmed — data gap in pre-market sources, cannot verify below the 28 threshold. Both conditions are required simultaneously per strategy. Research produced strong candidates — AMD 94/100, RIVN 82/100, AMZN 77/100 — but neither market condition was cleared. No order was placed. Re-run context check after 9:35 AM ET market open to see if conditions normalize.

## 2026-06-30 09:30 ET
No trade placed on 2026-06-30 (market open session). Reason: SPY below 5-day moving average (~$729 vs MA ~$739-$740) — entry criterion NOT MET. VIX at 17.56 is below 28 (criterion met), but both conditions must be true. Top candidates AMD (77/100) and TSLA (71/100) are pre-staged and remain eligible if SPY reclaims 5-day MA. TRADE_OK: no per daily_context.md and research_cache.md. No orders submitted to Alpaca paper account. Weekly trade counter unchanged at 0/3.

## 2026-06-30 09:35 ET — Market Open Routine (Scheduled Task)
No trade placed. Market open routine ran all checks: daily_loss_halt=false ✅, trades_this_week=0/3 ✅. Research candidates: AMD 77/100, TSLA 71/100 — both above 70 threshold. No open positions held. Market context check (Step 8) failed: SPY ~$729 is ~$10 below 5-day MA ~$739-$740. TRADE_OK=no. VIX=17.56 (below 28 ✅) but SPY criterion not met — both must be true per strategy. No order submitted to Alpaca paper account. AMD and TSLA remain pre-staged for entry if SPY reclaims its 5-day MA.

## 2026-07-01 pre-market ET
Research complete. 16 tickers scanned (15 equities + SH inverse ETF). Top candidates: RIVN(77), GOOGL(75), AAPL(70). Market TRADE_OK=yes — SPY reclaimed 5-day MA ($746.77 vs MA $736.86), VIX ~16.5. SH not applicable (SPY in uptrend). RIVN and GOOGL are primary watch targets pending volume confirmation at open. Notable score changes from yesterday: RIVN 52→77 (R2 launch + Uber robotaxi deal), GOOGL 69→75 (Dow inclusion inflows), TSLA 71→57 (weakening catalyst set), COIN 9→56 (regulatory backdrop improvement).

## [2026-07-01 10:21 ET]
Market-open trade evaluation 2026-07-01: SPY reclaimed 5-day MA today ($746.56 vs MA $739.35) — TRADE_OK flipped to YES vs yesterday's NO. VIX estimated ~16.5 (below 28 threshold). No open positions. Top candidates RIVN (77/100), GOOGL (75/100), AAPL (70/100) evaluated — NONE met the volume criterion (≥2x 30-day average). RIVN: research scores volume 18/20 and flags "confirm 2x avg at open" — cannot verify via Alpaca IEX partial feed at 10:21 ET; full-market volume unconfirmable at this hour. GOOGL: research confirms 1.66x (48.67M vs 29.33M avg) — below 2x threshold. AAPL: below average at ~94% of 30-day avg (8/20 volume score). No trade placed. Volume criterion not met for any candidate. AMD and TSLA dropped below 70 threshold since yesterday's stale cache. All criteria must be true simultaneously per strategy. trades_this_week remains 0/3. Recommend running /research again intraday if volume surges on RIVN (R2 launch + Uber robotaxi deal is a live catalyst).

Research complete. 15 tickers scanned + SH. Top candidates: COIN(84), AMD(78), NVDA(76). Market TRADE_OK=yes, VIX=16.58. SPY and QQQ above 5-day MA — bullish. SMCI flagged DO NOT TRADE (government raid on Taiwan offices re: alleged Nvidia chip smuggling). SH scored 12/100 — inverse ETF thesis invalid (SPY near ATH). GOOGL also eligible at 75/100 (Cloud +63%, Gemini 750M users). TSLA Q2 delivery report due today — event risk, score may shift post-report.

## [2026-07-02 09:52 ET]
Market-open trade evaluation 2026-07-02: No trade placed. All 4 eligible candidates (COIN 84, AMD 78, NVDA 76, GOOGL 75) passed score, SPY/VIX, and asset-class checks but FAILED the 2x 30-day average volume criterion. Volume ratios vs 30-day SIP average: COIN 1.35x (need 17.8M, got 12.0M Jul1); AMD 0.89x; NVDA 0.87x; GOOGL 0.70x. COIN was closest — massive Open USD stablecoin catalyst Jul1 (+11.87%) elevated volume but not to 2x. Research cache scored COIN volume 18/20 based on inference from price action, not confirmed API data. Today's COIN opening pace (IEX: 34,381 shares in 15min, estimated SIP: ~16.3M projected at 7% of-day) still below 2x threshold even at optimistic projection. Hard rule applied: volume criterion must be met for entry. Weekly trade counter remains at 0/3. Flag for research agent: volume scoring should use confirmed Alpaca SIP data rather than price-action inference.

## 2026-07-06 11:11 ET
Market-open run executed. All 15 watchlist candidates (SPY, PLTR, TSLA, AMD, AAPL, QQQ, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, SMCI, MSFT, SOFI, RIVN, META, COIN) failed the technical/volume check - volume_ratio computed as ~0.0x-0.1x of 30-day average for every ticker (min required 1.25x), so none reached risk_manager.approve_entry(). No trade placed today. Daily halt flag was false and trades_this_week was 0/3 going in. Note: research_cache.md and daily_context.md were last refreshed 2026-07-04 (stale, 2 days old) and daily_context.md explicitly reads TRADE_OK: no with VIX unconfirmed - pre-market research should be re-run before next market-open attempt.

## [2026-07-07 20:37 ET]
Market-open run. No halt, trades_this_week=0/3 — proceeded to /trade. research_cache.md candidates >=70: PLTR (77), TSLA (75), AMD (71); SPY (80) excluded as market benchmark, not a tradeable alpha candidate. daily_context.md: SPY 744.78 above 5-day MA 742.96, VIX 15.81 — TRADE_OK, regular stock entries permitted (no SH needed). No trade was placed: the live Alpaca API verification/order-placement step could not be executed this run — the automation environment's security classifier blocked running the execution script after a (stale/inaccurate) credential-leakage flag from an earlier agent pass, even though the script only read credentials from .env via the existing utils/alpaca_client.py, no keys were hardcoded. The stray script was deleted; no memory files were altered beyond this log. Recommend the user review Bash execution permissions for this project so future market-open runs can complete steps 6-10 (live position/account check, volume confirmation, order placement).

Also passing threshold: PLTR (75), TSLA (73), AMZN (70 borderline). SMCI (18) flagged AVOID — escalating Taiwan export-violation criminal probe. Market: TRADE_OK=yes, SPY ~750 above 5-day MA ~743, VIX ~15.81 (well below 28 cap) — SH inverse not triggered. Scores written to research_cache.md, context to daily_context.md.

## [2026-07-07 20:37 ET] — Market-Open (duplicate detection)
This scheduled market-open run appears to be a duplicate — the reasoning log already shows a market-open run completed at 20:37 ET today with these exact same candidates, and trade_trigger.md is already committed with status: done. No trade was placed (execution script was blocked), and weekly_trade_counter.md still shows 0/3 trades. I'll log this duplicate-detection instead of re-writing the trigger file.
