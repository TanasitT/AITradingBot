Intraday monitor (9:30 AM ET scheduled run). weekly_trade_counter.md: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07). open_positions.md said "no open positions," but Alpaca GET /v2/positions live shows META (7sh, avg entry $640.637143) opened by today's 08:37 ET market-open trigger — never recorded here or in trade_log.md. Same memory/live-account drift previously flagged 2026-07-16/17; git status still shows uncommitted in-progress edits to engine/coordinator.py, engine/risk_manager.py, engine/technical.py, engine/reporter.py, utils/alpaca_client.py — likely still the cause. Treated Alpaca as source of truth. META current price $642.64 (+0.31% vs entry) — stop-loss $608.61, TP1 $691.89, neither hit. Not SH, no inverse-ETF logic applies. Alpaca GET /v2/account: equity $99,662.00 vs last_equity $99,648.12 — daily P&L +0.014%, well within the -2% halt threshold. daily_loss_halt remains false. No exits executed, no trades placed, no alerts sent. Updated open_positions.md to record the untracked position with computed stop/TP levels (order ID unknown — fill was never logged). Flagging again: root-cause why coordinator isn't writing position records on fill.

Intraday monitor (10:30 AM ET scheduled run). weekly_trade_counter.md: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07). open_positions.md: AAPL (14sh, entry $333.806428) and META (7sh, entry $639.67), both regular stocks (not SH) — carried over from the previous 09:30 ET check. Alpaca GET /v2/positions confirmed: AAPL current $334.01 (+0.06% from entry, unrealized +$2.85) — stop-loss $317.12, TP1 $360.51, neither hit. META current $630.29 (-1.47% from entry, unrealized -$65.66) — stop-loss $607.69, TP1 $690.84, neither hit. Alpaca GET /v2/account: equity $99,549.04 vs last_equity $99,613.15 — daily P&L -0.06%, well within the -2% halt threshold. daily_loss_halt remains false. No exits executed, no trades placed, no alerts sent. Updated open_positions.md with this check's results.

Intraday monitor (11:30 AM ET scheduled run). weekly_trade_counter.md: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07) — no halt, proceeded. open_positions.md: AAPL (14sh, entry $333.806428) and META (7sh, entry $639.67), both regular stocks (no SH held, so no SPY/5-day MA check needed). Alpaca GET /v2/positions: AAPL current $331.85 (-0.59% from entry) — stop-loss $317.12, TP1 $360.51, neither hit. META current $643.71 (+0.63% from entry) — stop-loss $607.69, TP1 $690.84, neither hit. Alpaca GET /v2/account: equity $99,613.73 vs last_equity $99,613.15 — daily P&L +0.0006%, well within the -2% halt threshold. daily_loss_halt remains false. No exits executed, no trades placed, no alerts sent. Updated open_positions.md with this check's results.

## [2026-07-17 09:30 ET]
Intraday monitor (9:30 AM ET scheduled run). weekly_trade_counter.md: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (reset). open_positions.md said "no open positions," but Alpaca GET /v2/positions live shows AAPL (14sh, entry $333.806428) and META (7sh, entry $639.67) currently held — neither was recorded in open_positions.md or trade_log.md. Same drift issue previously flagged 2026-07-16 EOD; git status still shows uncommitted in-progress edits to engine/coordinator.py, engine/risk_manager.py, engine/technical.py, utils/alpaca_client.py — likely cause (trades executed by code under active modification, bypassing the normal memory-write path). Treated Alpaca as source of truth. Checked both against exit criteria: AAPL current $333.935 (+0.04% from entry) — stop-loss $317.12, TP1 $360.51, neither hit. META current $633.59 (-0.96% from entry) — stop-loss $607.69, TP1 $690.84, neither hit. Both regular stocks (not SH), no inverse-ETF logic applies. Alpaca GET /v2/account: equity $99,566.20 vs last_equity $99,613.15 — daily P&L -0.047%, well within the -2% halt threshold. daily_loss_halt remains false. No exits executed, no trades placed, no alerts sent. Updated open_positions.md to record the two untracked positions with computed stop/TP levels (entry date and order ID unknown — fills were never logged) so subsequent routines can check them correctly. Flagging again: root-cause why coordinator isn't writing position records on fill.

## [2026-07-16 EOD ET] — Stale Memory Files Detected
EOD close routine (Friday 2:47 AM ICT scheduled run, closing the 2026-07-16 Thursday session). Read open_positions.md (showed only AMZN, 19sh @ $254.25) and Alpaca GET /v2/positions live — live account actually held THREE positions: AMZN (19sh), META (7sh @ $678.03), NVDA (23sh @ $208.50). Neither open_positions.md nor trade_log.md recorded the META or NVDA entries. git status shows uncommitted in-progress edits to engine/coordinator.py, engine/risk_manager.py, engine/technical.py, memory/trade_trigger.md, utils/alpaca_client.py — likely cause of the memory/live-account drift (trades executed by code under active modification, bypassing the normal memory-write path). Treated Alpaca as source of truth and proceeded to evaluate all three live positions for overnight hold. Flagging for follow-up: reconcile open_positions.md/trade_log.md with Alpaca and check why the coordinator isn't writing position records on fill.

## [2026-07-16 EOD ET] — Overnight Thesis Check (AMZN, META, NVDA)
Perplexity/web research for all three held tickers found no overnight-specific catalyst for tomorrow (2026-07-17):
- AMZN: next catalyst is Q2 earnings 2026-07-30 (14 days out); Prime Day already priced in; RSI 72 overbought.
- META: next catalyst is Q2 earnings 2026-07-29 (13 days out); Meta Compute/Iris chip news already priced in this week.
- NVDA: next catalysts are MSFT/GOOGL earnings 2026-07-29 and NVDA's own FY27 Q2 earnings 2026-08-26 — weeks out.
No confirmed near-term (next trading day) catalyst for any position. Force-close trigger applied per strategy.md: "end-of-day with no overnight thesis." Cancelled AMZN's outstanding GTC stop-limit order (id 6824c992, blocking qty_available) then submitted market sell-to-close for all three.

Research complete. 16 tickers scanned (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, AMD, SMCI, PLTR, SOFI, RIVN, COIN, SPY, QQQ, SH).

## 2026-06-22 15:48 ET — EOD Overnight Thesis Check

**Routine:** eod_position_review

Queried Perplexity AI for NVDA overnight thesis. Result: CLOSE recommended, confidence 68/100. No confirmed near-term catalyst for tomorrow (2026-06-23). Key risks cited: valuation elevated ($5T mkt cap, high expectations already priced in), no specific event catalyst tomorrow, macro/China policy uncertainty. Long-term bull case intact (Strong Buy consensus, $275 avg PT, Vera Rubin H2 launch) but insufficient for overnight hold per strategy exit criteria. Force-close trigger applied: "end-of-day with no overnight thesis."

## [2026-07-07 20:37 ET] — Market Open Trade Trigger Written

Market-open routine executed. Pre-checks: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 — clear to proceed. research_cache.md candidates >=70 (excluding SPY/QQQ benchmarks): NVDA (82), META (80), MSFT (78), PLTR (75), TSLA (73), AMZN (70 borderline). open_positions.md: none held. daily_context.md: SPY ~$750.19 above 5-day MA ~$742.96, VIX ~15.81 (well below 28) — TRADE_OK=yes, regular stock entries permitted, SH inverse not triggered. Wrote memory/trade_trigger.md (status: pending) with all six candidates for the Python executor to verify buying power/positions via Alpaca API and place a limit order on the top qualifying candidate, enforcing the 5% position size cap. Did not update open_positions.md, trade_log.md, or weekly_trade_counter.md — those are owned by the Python executor upon fill confirmation.
---

## [2026-07-07 20:38 ET] — Trade Trigger Processed, No Fill Recorded

Python executor flipped memory/trade_trigger.md status from pending to done, but open_positions.md, trade_log.md, and weekly_trade_counter.md (trades_this_week still 0/3) show no new position or fill. Executor likely rejected all six candidates during its own live checks (volume confirmation, buying power, or another guard) without leaving a reason in these memory files. No trade was placed this session. Recommend checking main.py's execution logs directly for the rejection reason on the next run.

Research complete. 13 tickers scanned. Top candidates: AMD(94), RIVN(82), AMZN(77). Market TRADE_OK=no, VIX=unconfirmed (Perplexity could not confirm VIX below 28; SPY near/below 5-day MA). Five tickers exceed entry threshold (>=70): AMD, RIVN, AMZN, NVDA(75), GOOGL(75). SMCI flagged bearish (36/100) on $7B dilution shock. No trades placed. Verify VIX and SPY 5-day MA at market open before any entries.
---

## 2026-06-29 09:30 ET
No trade placed on 2026-06-29. Market context check (Step 8) failed: (1) SPY is near/slightly below its 5-day MA — entry criterion requires SPY *above* 5-day MA; (2) VIX is unconfirmed — data gap in pre-market sources, cannot verify below the 28 threshold. Both conditions are required simultaneously per strategy. Research produced strong candidates — AMD 94/100, RIVN 82/100, AMZN 77/100 — but neither market condition was cleared. No order was placed. Re-run context check after 9:35 AM ET market open to see if conditions normalize.

GOOGL borderline at 69: Dow inclusion + Cloud +63% + 2x volume but 1pt below 70 threshold. SMCI avoid (-27% on illegal export allegations). COIN avoid (-19% week, Baird bearish downgrade).
---

## 2026-06-30 09:30 ET
No trade placed on 2026-06-30 (market open session). Reason: SPY below 5-day moving average (~$729 vs MA ~$739-$740) — entry criterion NOT MET. VIX at 17.56 is below 28 (criterion met), but both conditions must be true. Top candidates AMD (77/100) and TSLA (71/100) are pre-staged and remain eligible if SPY reclaims 5-day MA.

Market context check (Step 8) failed: SPY ~$729 is ~$10 below 5-day MA ~$739-$740. TRADE_OK=no. VIX=17.56 (below 28 ✅) but SPY criterion not met — both must be true per strategy. No order submitted to Alpaca paper account. AMD and TSLA remain pre-staged for entry if SPY reclaims its 5-day MA.

Research complete. 16 tickers scanned (15 equities + SH inverse ETF). Top candidates: RIVN(77), GOOGL(75), AAPL(70). Market TRADE_OK=yes — SPY reclaimed 5-day MA ($746.77 vs MA $736.86), VIX ~16.5. SH not applicable (SPY in uptrend). RIVN and GOOGL are primary watch targets pending volume confirmation at open. Notable score changes from yesterday: RIVN 52→77 (R2 launch + Uber robotaxi deal), GOOGL 69→75 (Dow inclusion inflows), TSLA 71→57 (weakening catalyst set), COIN 9→56 (regulatory backdrop improvement).

## [2026-07-01 10:21 ET]
Market-open trade evaluation 2026-07-01: SPY reclaimed 5-day MA today ($746.56 vs MA $739.35) — TRADE_OK flipped to YES vs yesterday's NO. VIX estimated ~16.5 (below 28 threshold). No open positions. Top candidates RIVN (77/100), GOOGL (75/100), AAPL (70/100) evaluated — NONE met the volume criterion (≥2x 30-day average). RIVN: research scores volume 18/20 and flags "confirm 2x avg at open" — cannot verify via Alpaca IEX partial feed at 10:21 ET; full-market volume unconfirmable at this hour. GOOGL: research confirms 1.66x (48.67M vs 29.33M avg) — below 2x threshold. AAPL: below average at ~94% of 30-day avg (8/20 volume score). No trade placed. Volume criterion not met for any candidate. AMD and TSLA dropped below 70 threshold since yesterday's stale cache. All criteria must be true simultaneously per strategy. trades_this_week remains 0/3. Recommend running /research again intraday if volume surges on RIVN (R2 launch + Uber robotaxi deal is a live catalyst).

## [2026-07-02 09:52 ET]
Market-open trade evaluation 2026-07-02: No trade placed. All 4 eligible candidates (COIN 84, AMD 78, NVDA 76, GOOGL 75) passed score, SPY/VIX, and asset-class checks but FAILED the 2x 30-day average volume criterion. Volume ratios vs 30-day SIP average: COIN 1.35x (need 17.8M, got 12.0M Jul1); AMD 0.89x; NVDA 0.87x; GOOGL 0.70x. COIN was closest — massive Open USD stablecoin catalyst Jul1 (+11.87%) elevated volume but not to 2x. Research cache scored COIN volume 18/20 based on inference from price action, not confirmed API data. Today's COIN opening pace (IEX: 34,381 shares in 15min, estimated SIP: ~16.3M projected at 7% of-day) still below 2x threshold even at optimistic projection. Hard rule applied: volume criterion must be met for entry. Weekly trade counter remains at 0/3. Flag for research agent: volume scoring should use confirmed Alpaca SIP data rather than price-action inference.

Intraday monitor (9:30 PM ICT / 9:30 AM ET scheduled run). Checks: weekly_trade_counter.md — daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07). Open positions: none in open_positions.md (last position, NVDA, closed EOD 2026-06-22). No stop-loss, take-profit, or SH inverse ETF exit checks required. No P&L halt check performed since no positions are open. No actions taken. All clear.

## 2026-07-06 11:11 ET
Market-open run executed. All 15 watchlist candidates (SPY, PLTR, TSLA, AMD, AAPL, QQQ, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, SMCI, MSFT, SOFI, RIVN, META, COIN) failed the technical/volume check - volume_ratio computed as ~0.0x-0.1x of 30-day average for every ticker (min required 1.25x), so none reached risk_manager.approve_entry(). No trade placed today. Daily halt flag was false and trades_this_week was 0/3 going in. Note: research_cache.md and daily_context.md were last refreshed 2026-07-04 (stale, 2 days old) and daily_context.md explicitly reads TRADE_OK: no with VIX unconfirmed - pre-market research should be re-run before next market-open attempt.

Market TRADE_OK=yes, VIX=15.81, SPY above 5-day MA (744.78 vs 742.96). research_cache.md and daily_context.md refreshed with today's date, resolving prior staleness noted in the last market-open run.

daily_loss_halt reset to false and trades_this_week reset to 0 in weekly_trade_counter.md as part of EOD routine (no halt was active; reset is routine housekeeping).
---

## [2026-07-07 20:37 ET]
Market-open run. No halt, trades_this_week=0/3 — proceeded to /trade. research_cache.md candidates >=70: PLTR (77), TSLA (75), AMD (71); SPY (80) excluded as market benchmark, not a tradeable alpha candidate. daily_context.md: SPY 744.78 above 5-day MA 742.96, VIX 15.81 — TRADE_OK, regular stock entries permitted (no SH needed). No trade was placed: the live Alpaca API verification/order-placement step could not be executed this run — the automation environment's security classifier blocked running the execution script after a (stale/inaccurate) credential-leakage flag from an earlier agent pass, even though the script only read credentials from .env via the existing utils/alpaca_client.py, no keys were hardcoded. The stray script was deleted; no memory files were altered beyond this log. Recommend the user review Bash execution permissions for this project so future market-open runs can complete steps 6-10 (live position/account check, volume confirmation, order placement).

Pre-market research complete. 16 tickers scanned (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, AMD, SMCI, PLTR, SOFI, RIVN, COIN, SPY, QQQ, SH). Top 3 candidates: NVDA (82) — Kyber delay denied, Goldman calls 21.7x fwd P/E "compelling", 38-analyst Strong Buy; META (80) — +9% on cloud pivot, Wells Fargo $767 target, earnings July 29; MSFT (78) — Azure leads 55% of CIO surveys, +4% on enterprise AI deal. Also passing threshold: PLTR (75), TSLA (73), AMZN (70 borderline). SMCI (18) flagged AVOID — escalating Taiwan export-violation criminal probe. Market: TRADE_OK=yes, SPY ~750 above 5-day MA ~743, VIX ~15.81 (well below 28 cap) — SH inverse not triggered. Scores written to research_cache.md, context to daily_context.md.
---

## [2026-07-07 20:37 ET] — Market-Open (duplicate detection)
This scheduled market-open run appears to be a duplicate — the reasoning log already shows a market-open run completed at 20:37 ET today with these exact same candidates, and trade_trigger.md is already committed with status: done. No trade was placed (execution script was blocked), and weekly_trade_counter.md still shows 0/3 trades. I'll log this duplicate-detection instead of re-writing the trigger file.
---

## [2026-07-07 20:58 ET] — Market-Open (duplicate detection, 2nd occurrence)
Scheduled market-open run invoked again. Checked strategy.md and weekly_trade_counter.md: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 — no halt. Checked research_cache.md, open_positions.md, daily_context.md: same candidate set as the 20:37 ET run (NVDA 82, META 80, MSFT 78, PLTR 75, TSLA 73, AMZN 70), TRADE_OK=yes, no open positions. memory/trade_trigger.md already exists with status: done, requested_at 20:37 ET, identical candidates — a prior run already wrote this trigger and a second prior run already logged this exact duplicate condition (see entry at 20:37 ET "Market-Open (duplicate detection)"). Not re-writing trade_trigger.md to avoid clobbering the executor's done status. No trade placed this invocation. Root cause of repeated firing not diagnosed here — recommend checking the scheduled-task/cron config for this routine (2--trading-bot-market-open) for a duplicate or misfiring trigger.
---

## [2026-07-07 21:30 ET] — Intraday Monitor
Intraday monitor (9:30 PM ET / scheduled 930 routine). weekly_trade_counter.md: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07) — clear to proceed. open_positions.md: none — portfolio flat/cash-only since NVDA closed EOD 2026-06-22, so no stop-loss, take-profit, or SH inverse ETF exit checks were required. No portfolio P&L halt check performed since there are no open positions to evaluate against the -2% cap. No exits, no trades, no alerts sent. All clear.

No portfolio P&L halt check performed since there are no open positions to evaluate against the -2% cap. No exits, no trades, no alerts sent. All clear.
---

## [2026-07-07 22:37 ET] — Market-Open (duplicate detection, 3rd occurrence)
Scheduled market-open run invoked again. Checked trade_trigger.md: already status: done, requested_at 20:37 ET, same candidate set (NVDA 82, META 80, MSFT 78, PLTR 75, TSLA 73, AMZN 70). trade_log.md and open_positions.md confirm no trade was actually placed by the executor this morning (0 trades logged, no open positions) — likely failed volume/technical validation on the executor side. weekly_trade_counter.md still 0/3, no halt. No new trigger written this invocation to avoid clobbering executor state. Recommend checking the scheduled-task config for routine "2--trading-bot-market-open" — it appears to be firing multiple times per day.
---

## [2026-07-07 23:30 ET] — Intraday Monitor

## [2026-07-08 08:33 ET] — Pre-Market Research
Research complete. 16 tickers scanned (15 watchlist + SH). Top candidates: META(82), TSLA(78), MSFT(76) — only 3 cleared the 70 threshold vs 7 yesterday. SH scored 35/100, not triggered (SPY still barely above 5-day MA by <$1). Market TRADE_OK=yes, VIX=16.36 (up 5.07% on Iran ceasefire collapse, still well below 28 halt threshold). NVDA dropped 82→68 (technical deterioration), RIVN collapsed 68→38 (75M share dilutive offering). Results written to research_cache.md and daily_context.md. Caution flagged for today's market-open routine given the narrower candidate pool and SPY's thin margin above its MA.
---

## [2026-07-08 20:37 ET] — Market Open Trade Trigger Written
Market-open routine executed. Pre-checks: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 — clear to proceed. research_cache.md candidates >=70 (excluding SPY/QQQ benchmarks): META (82), TSLA (78), MSFT (76). open_positions.md: none held. daily_context.md: SPY ~$743–744 barely above 5-day MA $742.96 (thin margin, <$1), VIX 16.36 (up 5.07% on Iran ceasefire collapse, still well below 28) — TRADE_OK=yes, regular stock entries permitted, SH not triggered (score 35 vs 60 threshold). Wrote memory/trade_trigger.md (status: pending) with all three candidates for the Python executor to verify buying power/positions via Alpaca API and place a limit order on the top qualifying candidate, enforcing the 5% position size cap. Did not update open_positions.md, trade_log.md, or weekly_trade_counter.md — those are owned by the Python executor upon fill confirmation. Flagged: SPY's razor-thin margin above its 5-day MA today (Iran geopolitical risk) — if SPY closes below $742.96, SH inverse mode activates for tomorrow.

## [2026-07-08 21:15 ET] — Market-Open (duplicate detection)
Scheduled market-open run invoked again. Checked trade_trigger.md: already status: done, requested_at 09:37 ET (logged as 20:37 ET above), same candidate set (META 82, TSLA 78, MSFT 76). trade_log.md and open_positions.md confirm no trade was actually placed by the executor (0 trades logged this week, no open positions) — likely rejected on a live volume/technical check on the executor side, same pattern as 2026-07-07. weekly_trade_counter.md still 0/3, no halt. No new trigger written this invocation to avoid clobbering executor state. This routine (2--trading-bot-market-open) continues to fire multiple times per session — recommend reviewing its scheduled-task/cron config to dedupe.

Market-open routine invoked. weekly_trade_counter.md: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07) — no halt. However, research_cache.md and daily_context.md are both still dated 2026-07-08 (last research run completed 2026-07-08 08:33 ET) — the pre-market-research routine has not yet produced fresh data for 2026-07-09. Trading on yesterday's SPY/VIX/score snapshot would not reflect current market conditions, so no trade_trigger.md was written this invocation.

Market TRADE_OK=yes, VIX=16.90, SPY $745.40 above 5-day MA ($742.96). Dominant catalyst: China conditionally allowing H200 chip sales to leading AI firms lifted the semiconductor sector (AMD +7.75%, NVDA/INTC/MU premarket rebound). SH score fell to 28 (thesis weakening) as SPY holds above its MA with improved cushion.

Portfolio held flat (no positions) while SPY continued its rally on the H200 chip export catalyst noted in this morning's research — today's negative alpha reflects opportunity cost of sitting in cash during an up day, not a losing trade.

However, research_cache.md and daily_context.md are both still dated 2026-07-09 (last research run completed 2026-07-09 15:51 ET) — the pre-market-research routine has not yet produced fresh data for today's session.

Alpaca GET /v2/account confirmed: equity $99,873.35 = last_equity $99,873.35 — daily P&L $0.00 (0.00%), well within the -2% halt threshold. daily_loss_halt remains false. No exits, no trades, no alerts sent. All clear. Note: uncommitted local changes present in engine/technical.py, memory/trade_trigger.md, and utils/alpaca_client.py from a prior session — left untouched, not part of this routine's scope.

## [2026-07-11 EOD ET]
EOD routine executed (scheduled Saturday EOD). open_positions.md confirmed empty (no SH held, no regular stock positions held) — no overnight thesis checks with Perplexity or force-close logic were required. Alpaca GET /v2/account and GET /v2/positions both confirmed: equity $99,873.35, cash $99,873.35, buying_power $399,493.40, 0 positions, status ACTIVE. Daily P&L $0.00 (equity == last_equity). portfolio_state.md updated.

## [2026-07-11 EOD ET] — Benchmark Logged
Benchmark logged. Portfolio: $99,873.35 (0.00%) | SPY: $755.10 (+0.47%) | Alpha: -0.47%. SPY price from latest Alpaca bar (2026-07-10 20:13 UTC print, Friday close since market closed Saturday). Portfolio held flat (no positions) while SPY continued its rally on the META/AI mega-cap narrative — negative alpha reflects opportunity cost of sitting in cash, not a losing trade.

Market-open routine executed. Pre-checks: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07) — clear to proceed. research_cache.md candidates >=70 (excluding SPY/QQQ benchmarks): META (86), NVDA (78), AMD (76), MSFT (72), AMZN (71). open_positions.md: none held (flat/cash-only since NVDA closed EOD 2026-06-22). daily_context.md: SPY ~$750-752 above 5-day MA ~$742-745 (solid cushion), VIX 15.67 (near monthly low, well below 28) — TRADE_OK=yes, regular stock entries permitted, SH not applicable. Wrote memory/trade_trigger.md (status: pending) with all five candidates for the Python executor to verify buying power/positions via Alpaca API, confirm volume, and place a limit order on the top qualifying candidate, enforcing the 5% position size cap. Did not update open_positions.md, trade_log.md, or weekly_trade_counter.md — those remain owned by the Python executor upon fill confirmation.

Noted: a stale trade_trigger.md from 2026-07-13 09:37 ET was still status:pending (never flipped to done by the executor) — overwrote it with today's fresh trigger since a new market-open cycle has started. Wrote memory/trade_trigger.md (status: pending) with the four qualifying candidates for the Python executor to verify buying power/positions via Alpaca API and place a limit order on the top qualifying candidate, enforcing the 5% position size cap.

## [2026-07-16 20:37 ET] — Market Open Trade Trigger Written
Market-open routine executed. Pre-checks: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=1/3 (AMZN bought 09:37 ET this morning) — clear to proceed for one more evaluation this week. research_cache.md candidates >=70 (excluding SPY/QQQ benchmarks): META (86), AMZN (75), NVDA (73), MSFT (72), AMD (71, volume-caution flagged). open_positions.md: AMZN 19 sh @ $254.25 already held (opened this morning). daily_context.md: SPY $754.47 above 5-day MA $742.96 (+$11.51 cushion), VIX 15.67 (well below 28) — TRADE_OK=yes, regular stock entries permitted, SH not triggered. Wrote memory/trade_trigger.md (status: pending) with all five candidates, flagging AMZN as already held, for the Python executor to verify buying power/positions via Alpaca API and place a limit order on the top qualifying new candidate (likely META, highest score and not yet held), enforcing the 5% position size cap and 3-trades/day limit.

## [2026-07-16 21:30 ET] — Intraday Monitor Check
daily_loss_halt=false, cleared to proceed. Single open position: AMZN, 19 sh @ $254.25 entry. Current price ~$256.42 (latest trade), +0.85% from entry — no exit trigger (stop-loss $241.54, TP1 $274.59/TP2 $292.39/TP3 $317.81 all not hit). No SH position held, so no inverse-ETF logic applies. Account equity $99,926.96 vs. prior-day equity $99,873.35 (+0.05%) — well within the -2% daily loss cap, no halt triggered. No exits executed; open_positions.md and trade_log.md unchanged.

Checked current price via Alpaca GET /v2/stocks/AMZN/bars/latest: $255.47 (+0.48% unrealized). Stop-loss $241.54 not hit. No take-profit tier hit (TP1 $274.59 needs +$19.12). No SH position held — SPY check not applicable. Alpaca GET /v2/account: equity $99,863.78 vs last_equity $99,873.35 — daily P&L -$9.57 (-0.0096%), well within -2% halt threshold. daily_loss_halt remains false.

## [2026-07-17 07:33 ET]
Research complete. 16 tickers scanned (15 active + SH). Top 3 candidates: META(84), AAPL(77, NEW — HSBC upgrade Hold->Buy, ATH $334.68), AMZN(75). MSFT(70) also cleared threshold but flagged (PT cuts from 3 firms). Market TRADE_OK=yes, VIX=16.73 (up from 15.67, tech selloff pressure, well below 28 halt). SPY $750.72, $7.76 above 5-day MA (cushion narrowing from $11.51). NVDA(68) and AMD(64) dropped below threshold on AI hardware selloff. SMCI(12) still AVOID — criminal probe + selloff. SH not triggered (score 20, SPY above 5d MA).

Market-open routine executed. Pre-checks passed: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07, cleared per Thursday 2026-07-16 EOD reset). research_cache.md candidates >=70 (excluding SPY/QQQ benchmarks): META (84), AAPL (77, new entry on HSBC Hold->Buy upgrade + ATH $334.68), AMZN (75), MSFT (70, borderline — 3-firm PT cut wave flagged). open_positions.md: no open positions (AMZN/META/NVDA all force-closed EOD 2026-07-16 on no-overnight-thesis). daily_context.md: SPY $750.72 above 5-day MA $742.96 (+$7.76 cushion, narrowing from $11.51), VIX ~16.73 (below 28) — TRADE_OK=yes, regular stock entries permitted, SH inverse not triggered (score 20/100, trigger not met). Wrote memory/trade_trigger.md (status: pending) with all four candidates for the Python executor to verify buying power/positions via Alpaca API, confirm volume >=1.25x 30-day avg (AAPL and MSFT specifically flagged for volume confirmation), and place a limit order on the top qualifying candidate within the 5% position size cap. Did not update open_positions.md, trade_log.md, or weekly_trade_counter.md — those are owned by the Python executor upon fill confirmation. Trigger picked up by executor (status flipped to "executing") shortly after writing.

## [2026-07-17 15:50 ET]
EOD Saturday-cycle routine (closing 2026-07-17 Friday session). No SH position held, so
the inverse-ETF check was skipped. Two regular positions found open on Alpaca (AAPL 14sh,
META 7sh) that had not previously appeared in open_positions.md/trade_log.md this cycle.
Checked Perplexity/web research for an overnight-specific catalyst on each:
- AAPL: ongoing bullish narrative (China Apple Intelligence approval, analyst upgrades),
  but next concrete catalyst is Q3 FY26 earnings on 7/30 and iPhone 18 launch in September
  — both 2+ weeks out, nothing overnight-specific.
- META: ongoing AI/Meta Compute cloud narrative and Iris chip news, but no near-term
  overnight-specific event; earnings not until 7/29.
No strong overnight thesis for either — force-close trigger applied per strategy.md exit
criteria. Sold 14 AAPL @ $333.86 (entry $333.806428, +$0.75/+0.02%) and 7 META @
$644.561428 (entry $639.67, +$34.23/+0.76%). Total realized P&L: +$34.98.

## [2026-07-20 pre-market-research ET]
Research complete. 16 tickers scanned (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, AMD, SMCI, PLTR, SOFI, RIVN, COIN, SPY, QQQ, SH). Top candidates: META (77), AMZN (73), AAPL (73) -- all above the 70 threshold, all require volume confirmation >=1.25x 30-day avg before entry. TSLA and GOOGL excluded (earnings July 22); AMD AI Conference July 22-23 also flagged as binary event risk. Market TRADE_OK=yes: SPY above 5-day MA, VIX ~18.77 (below 28 halt threshold but up 12.19% in a single session -- highest recent reading). SPY's cushion above its 5-day MA has collapsed to $0.33 from $7.76 three days ago -- fragile, could flip to SH-mode intraday if SPY opens flat/down. SH inverse ETF score rose to 38 (from 20); re-score if SPY crosses below $742.96. research_cache.md and daily_context.md updated.

## [2026-07-20 08:37 ET] -- Market Open Trade Trigger Written
Market-open routine executed. Pre-checks: daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 (week of 2026-07-07) -- clear to proceed. research_cache.md candidates >=70 (excluding SPY/QQQ benchmarks): META (77), AMZN (73), AAPL (73). open_positions.md: none held. daily_context.md: SPY $743.29 above 5-day MA $742.96 (+$0.33 cushion, thin but positive), VIX 18.77 (below 28) -- TRADE_OK=yes, regular stock entries permitted, SH inverse not triggered (SPY still above MA). Overwrote the stale 2026-07-17 20:37 ET trade_trigger.md (which had been left in status: error -- 403 Forbidden from the paper API) with a fresh pending trigger listing META:77, AMZN:73, AAPL:73 for the Python executor to verify buying power/positions via Alpaca API, confirm volume >=1.25x 30-day avg, and place a limit order on the top qualifying candidate, enforcing the 5% position size cap. Did not update open_positions.md, trade_log.md, or weekly_trade_counter.md -- those are owned by the Python executor upon fill confirmation. Flagging: the prior trigger's 403 error was never resolved/journaled -- if this one also errors, escalate to the user about Alpaca API credentials/permissions.
---

## [2026-07-20 09:52 ET] -- Market Open Routine Re-run, Trade Trigger Refreshed
Market-open scheduled task fired again. Pre-checks: weekly_trade_counter.md shows daily_loss_halt=false, trades_this_week=0/3 -- clear to proceed (note: the 08:37 ET trigger today apparently resulted in a live META fill per open_positions.md/Alpaca, 7sh @ $640.637143, despite trade_trigger.md having been left in status: error/403 Forbidden -- counter was never incremented for it, a known memory/live-account drift documented in open_positions.md and tied to the uncommitted edits in engine/coordinator.py, engine/risk_manager.py, engine/technical.py, engine/reporter.py, utils/alpaca_client.py per git status). research_cache.md unchanged since pre-market: META (77), AMZN (73), AAPL (73) above threshold; TSLA/GOOGL blocked (earnings Jul 22, 2 days out); daily_context.md TRADE_OK=yes, SPY $743.29 above 5-day MA $742.96 (+$0.33 cushion, still thin), VIX 18.77. Wrote a fresh pending trade_trigger.md with candidates META:77, AMZN:73, AAPL:73 and already_held: META (7sh) noted explicitly so the Python executor does not double-enter META. Did not touch open_positions.md, trade_log.md, or weekly_trade_counter.md. Flagging again for the user: the coordinator/risk_manager/technical/reporter/alpaca_client uncommitted edits should be reviewed/committed or reverted -- they appear to be the root cause of both the 403 trigger errors and the fills-not-logged drift across multiple routines this week.
