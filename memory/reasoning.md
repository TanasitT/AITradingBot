## 2026-06-22 15:48 ET — EOD Overnight Thesis Check

**Routine:** eod_position_review

Queried Perplexity AI for NVDA overnight thesis. Result: CLOSE recommended, confidence 68/100. No confirmed near-term catalyst for tomorrow (2026-06-23). Key risks cited: valuation elevated ($5T mkt cap, high expectations already priced in), no specific event catalyst tomorrow, macro/China policy uncertainty. Long-term bull case intact (Strong Buy consensus, $275 avg PT, Vera Rubin H2 launch) but insufficient for overnight hold per strategy exit criteria. Force-close trigger applied: "end-of-day with no overnight thesis."

## 2026-06-22 15:48 ET — NVDA EOD Close Executed

Submitted market sell order for 23 shares NVDA. Order ID: 9317f93a-81f0-4727-bdbf-2f04439647be. Fill price: ~$207.88. Exit value: $4,781.24. Entry cost: $4,907.87. Trade P&L: -$126.63 (-2.58% from entry $213.3857). Position held approximately 6 hours (09:39–15:48 ET). Reason: no overnight thesis per Perplexity AI (confidence 68).

Research complete. 13 tickers scanned. Top candidates: AMD(94), RIVN(82), AMZN(77). Market TRADE_OK=no, VIX=unconfirmed (Perplexity could not confirm VIX below 28; SPY near/below 5-day MA). Five tickers exceed entry threshold (>=70): AMD, RIVN, AMZN, NVDA(75), GOOGL(75). SMCI flagged bearish (36/100) on $7B dilution shock. No trades placed.

## 2026-06-29 09:30 ET
No trade placed on 2026-06-29. Market context check (Step 8) failed: (1) SPY is near/slightly below its 5-day MA — entry criterion requires SPY *above* 5-day MA; (2) VIX is unconfirmed — data gap in pre-market sources, cannot verify below the 28 threshold. Both conditions are required simultaneously per strategy. Research produced strong candidates — AMD 94/100, RIVN 82/100, AMZN 77/100 — but neither market condition was cleared. No order was placed. Re-run context check after 9:35 AM ET market open to see if conditions normalize.

Research complete. 13 tickers scanned. Top candidates: AMD(77), TSLA(71), GOOGL(69-watch). Market TRADE_OK=no (SPY ~$729 below 5-day MA ~$740). VIX=17.56 (low, below 28).

GOOGL borderline at 69: Dow inclusion + Cloud +63% + 2x volume but 1pt below 70 threshold. SMCI avoid (-27% on illegal export allegations). COIN avoid (-19% week, Baird bearish downgrade).
---

## 2026-06-30 09:30 ET
No trade placed on 2026-06-30 (market open session). Reason: SPY below 5-day moving average (~$729 vs MA ~$739-$740) — entry criterion NOT MET. VIX at 17.56 is below 28 (criterion met), but both conditions must be true. Top candidates AMD (77/100) and TSLA (71/100) are pre-staged and remain eligible if SPY reclaims 5-day MA. TRADE_OK: no per daily_context.md and research_cache.md. No orders submitted to Alpaca paper account. Weekly trade counter unchanged at 0/3.

Market context check (Step 8) failed: SPY ~$729 is ~$10 below 5-day MA ~$739-$740. TRADE_OK=no. VIX=17.56 (below 28 ✅) but SPY criterion not met — both must be true per strategy. No order submitted to Alpaca paper account. AMD and TSLA remain pre-staged for entry if SPY reclaims its 5-day MA.
