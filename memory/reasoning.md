## 2026-06-22 15:48 ET — EOD Overnight Thesis Check

**Routine:** eod_position_review

Queried Perplexity AI for NVDA overnight thesis. Result: CLOSE recommended, confidence 68/100. No confirmed near-term catalyst for tomorrow (2026-06-23). Key risks cited: valuation elevated ($5T mkt cap, high expectations already priced in), no specific event catalyst tomorrow, macro/China policy uncertainty. Long-term bull case intact (Strong Buy consensus, $275 avg PT, Vera Rubin H2 launch) but insufficient for overnight hold per strategy exit criteria. Force-close trigger applied: "end-of-day with no overnight thesis."
