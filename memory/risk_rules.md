## Inverse ETF Rules
- Allowed tickers: SH only (1x inverse SPY — no leveraged inverse ETFs)
- Max position size: 3% of portfolio (vs 5% for stocks)
- Entry condition: SPY below 5-day MA (this REPLACES the SPY-above-MA requirement)
- Min score to enter: 60/100 (vs 70 for stocks — inverse ETFs score differently)
- Exit trigger: SPY reclaims 5-day MA → close SH immediately regardless of P&L
- Do not hold SH and a long stock position at the same time
