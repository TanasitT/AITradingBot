# AITradingBot — User Manual

A plain-English guide to how the bot works, what it does, and all the rules it follows.

---

## What This Bot Does

The bot monitors the US stock market every day and automatically:
1. Researches stocks using AI (Perplexity)
2. Decides whether to buy based on a strict set of rules
3. Monitors open positions every hour and exits when targets are hit
4. Sends you an end-of-day email report
5. Keeps a journal of every decision it makes

All trading happens on **Alpaca** (currently paper trading — fake money, no real risk).

## Key Terms Explained

| Term | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **SPY** | An ETF that tracks the 500 biggest US companies. It goes up when the overall market goes up. Used as the market's health indicator. |
| **VIX** | The "Fear Gauge." Measures how nervous investors are. Low VIX (< 20) = calm market. High VIX (> 28) = fearful, choppy market — bot avoids trading. |
| **5-day MA** | Moving Average — the average price of SPY over the last 5 trading days. If today's SPY price is above this average, the market is in an uptrend. |
| **Volume** | How many shares of a stock are traded today vs the normal daily amount. High volume = big investors are active in that stock. |
| **Stop-loss** | A safety net price. If the stock falls this far below your buy price, the bot sells automatically to cut the loss. |
| **Take-profit** | A target price. When the stock rises this much, the bot sells a portion to lock in gains. |
| **Paper trading** | Trading with fake money to test the strategy. Works exactly like real trading but no real money at risk. |
| **ETF** | Exchange Traded Fund — a basket of stocks you can buy as a single share. SPY holds all 500 S&P 500 stocks. |
| **Inverse ETF** | An ETF that moves opposite to the market. When SPY goes down 1%, SH goes up 1%. Used to profit during market downturns. |
| **Research score** | A score from 0–100 the bot assigns each stock after analyzing news, analyst opinions, volume, and technical charts. |
| **Portfolio** | Your total account value — cash + value of stocks currently held. |
| **Equity** | Another word for your total portfolio value (cash + investments). |
| **Alpha** | How much better (or worse) you did vs SPY. +1% alpha means you beat the market by 1% that day. |

## The 5 Rules Before Any Trade

All 5 must be true at the same time. If any one fails, no trade is placed.

### Rule 1 — Research Score ≥ 70/100
The bot asks Perplexity AI to analyze each stock across 6 dimensions:
- Recent news and catalysts (last 48 hours)
- Analyst upgrades/downgrades and price targets
- Volume vs 30-day average
- Price vs 50-day and 200-day moving averages
- RSI (momentum indicator)
- Sector momentum

A score below 70 means the signal is too weak to risk money.

### Rule 2 — Volume ≥ 2x Normal
The stock must be trading at least twice its normal daily volume. This confirms that big institutional investors are active — not just retail noise.

### Rule 3 — SPY Above Its 5-Day Average
The overall market must be in an uptrend. If the whole market is falling, even good stocks tend to fall with it. The bot waits for market health before entering.

**Exception:** When SPY is BELOW the 5-day average, the bot switches to evaluating SH (inverse ETF) instead of regular stocks.

### Rule 4 — VIX Below 28
Fear must be low enough to trade. When VIX is above 28, markets are volatile and unpredictable — stops get hit randomly, even correct trades lose money. The bot sits in cash.

### Rule 5 — No Existing Halt
- Daily portfolio loss must be below 2%
- Daily trade count must be below 3

---

## Position Sizing

The bot never risks more than **5% of total portfolio per trade**.

| Portfolio Value | Max Per Trade |
|---|---|
| $100,000 | $5,000 |
| $50,000 | $2,500 |
| $10,000 | $500 |

For SH (inverse ETF): max is **3% of portfolio** — smaller because inverse ETFs can reverse quickly.

---

## Exit Rules

### Stop-Loss (cut losses)
| Stock Type | Stop-Loss Level |
|---|---|
| Regular stocks | 5% below entry price |
| High-beta stocks (volatile, beta > 1.5) | 7% below entry price |
| SH (inverse ETF) | 5% below entry price |

### Take-Profit (lock in gains — sold in 3 stages)
| Level | Gain | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | +8% | Sell 33% of position |
| Tier 2 | +15% | Sell another 33% |
| Tier 3 | +25% | Sell final 34% |

### Force-Close Triggers (sell immediately regardless of P&L)
- Perplexity AI detects a major negative news reversal for the stock
- VIX spikes above 30 during the day
- End of day and no strong reason to hold overnight (confirmed by Perplexity)
- SPY reclaims its 5-day MA while holding SH (inverse ETF thesis is resolved)

---

## Inverse ETF Mode (SH)

When the market is in a short-term pullback (SPY below 5-day MA), the bot switches into inverse ETF mode:

- **What it buys:** SH — a fund that goes up when SPY goes down
- **Entry threshold:** Score ≥ 60 (lower than the 70 required for stocks)
- **Position size:** 3% of portfolio max (vs 5% for stocks)
- **Exit trigger:** As soon as SPY recovers above its 5-day MA, SH is sold — the thesis is gone
- **Why only SH:** SH is 1x (not leveraged). Leveraged inverse ETFs (SQQQ, SPXS) are too risky

---

## Hard Rules (Cannot Be Changed Without Code)

These are enforced in the code — they cannot be overridden by editing memory files:

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Max position size | 5% of portfolio (3% for SH) |
| Daily loss halt | -2% triggers full stop for the day |
| Max trades per day | 3 |
| No options | Only stocks and approved ETFs |
| Paper trading | Until `live_trading: true` is set in strategy.md |

---

## Memory Files (The Bot's Brain)

All state is stored as text files in the `memory/` folder. You can read and edit these directly.

| File | What It Contains |
|---|---|
| `strategy.md` | Master rules — the bot reads this first every single run |
| `watchlist.md` | Stocks the bot monitors + inverse ETFs |
| `research_cache.md` | Latest scores for each stock (refreshed daily) |
| `daily_context.md` | Today's SPY trend, VIX level, sector leaders |
| `open_positions.md` | All currently held positions with entry, stop, and targets |
| `trade_log.md` | Complete history of every trade ever made |
| `portfolio_state.md` | Current cash, equity, and daily P&L |
| `weekly_trade_counter.md` | Trades placed today + halt flags |
| `benchmark_tracking.md` | Daily portfolio vs SPY performance comparison |
| `performance_metrics.md` | Overall win rate, profit factor, all-time stats |
| `learned_patterns.md` | Weekly reflections on what worked and what didn't |
| `reasoning.md` | Append-only journal of every bot decision |
| `risk_rules.md` | Numerical thresholds (editable to tune the bot) |
| `news_events.md` | Upcoming earnings, Fed meetings, economic calendar |
| `pending_orders.md` | Orders placed but awaiting fill |

---

## Tuning the Bot (Without Code)

Edit `memory/risk_rules.md` to adjust thresholds. Changes take effect on the next routine run.

Common adjustments:
- Raise `Min research score` from 70 to 80 → fewer but higher-conviction trades
- Lower `Max VIX` from 28 to 22 → only trade in very calm markets
- Change `SPY must be above N-day MA` from 5 to 10 → require a longer confirmed uptrend

Do NOT edit `memory/strategy.md` hard rules unless you fully understand the consequences.

---

## How to Switch to Live Trading

When you are ready to trade real money:

1. Open `memory/strategy.md`
2. Change `live_trading: false` to `live_trading: true`
3. Make sure your `.env` file has your **live** Alpaca API keys (not paper keys)
4. The bot will automatically use the live account on the next run

**Recommended:** Only do this after at least 4 weeks of paper trading with consistent positive results.

---

## Email Reports

The bot sends emails to `jankla2010@gmail.com` for:
- End-of-day summary (daily P&L, trades, open positions, vs SPY)
- Trade alerts (when a buy or sell is executed)
- Halt alerts (when the -2% daily loss cap is triggered)
- Weekly summary (every Saturday — full week performance)

---
